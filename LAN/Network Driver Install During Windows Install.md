## Step-by-Step Process:

### 1. Identify Your Network Hardware
* On another working PC:
  * Check the manufacturer and model of the target PC or its network card (Intel, Realtek, etc.).
  * Go to the official website (e.g., Dell, Lenovo, Realtek, Intel).

### 3. Download the Correct Drivers
* Download the LAN and Wi-Fi drivers for the exact model and OS version (e.g., Windows 11 - Version 21H2, 64-bit ).
* Look for `.INF`-based versions, or extractable ZIP files (not `.EXE` if you‚Äôll use them during install).

If you have the `.INF` or extracted driver files, you may skip Step 4 and proceed directly to Step 5.

### 4. Driver Preparation (When .INF is not available directly)
* Download the `.exe` driver file from the official manufacturer‚Äôs website.
* Run the downloaded `.exe` file.
* On the setup window, click **Next** >.
* **Accept** the License Agreement if prompted.
* Choose the **‚ÄúExtract‚Äù** option instead of ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù (if available).
* Select a destination folder where the files will be extracted (`e.g., USB_Drive:\Drivers\LAN`).
* Complete the extraction process.

üí°Alternative: You can also use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to open the .exe and manually extract `.INF`, `.SYS`, and `.CAT` files to USB_Drive.

### 5. Driver Preparation (When you have the `.INF` or extracted driver files)
* Format a USB stick to FAT32 for compatibility.
* Create a folder (e.g., Drivers).
* Copy the extracted drivers (not EXE installers) into it.


### 6. Load Driver During Windows Installation
